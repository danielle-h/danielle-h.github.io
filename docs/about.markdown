I actually didn't know what programming was before I arrived at university. I knew since I was 8 that I wanted to be a physicist, because I asked a lot of questions, and at some point I started asking "What do I need to learn to know the answer to this question...?" and the answer was always "Physics". And in high school (only girl out of 11 in physics :grimacing: ) I discovered lasers.  

Lasers are cool.

So _obviously_ I wanted to learn physics. I considered Physics and Music, but in the end I decided on Physics and Computer Science, because I figured programming would be very useful as a physicist. And slowly I became more and more hooked. 

The epiphany came somewhere in the middle of my PhD in Applied Physics. I had been working as a programmer for a few years by then, and after spending roughly 3 months aligning the *@#$ system for my experiment in physics I realized that I actually enjoy programming more. You get a result so __fast__. It might not be the result you want, but at least you get feedback quickly. And you can create almost anything, from a [mobile app for research](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weizmann.worg.smellitapp) to an [abstract video](https://youtu.be/0BVqFYParRs?t=173).

So I started working as a physicist and programmer, and then I programmed for physicists, and now I'm programming for (mostly) neurobiologists at the [Olfaction Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg/) at the Weizmann Institute of Science. I also lecture there.

I also play sing and play the piano. I have some songs in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-r1kUHMs_zUdbzpRfdPoJ0yGWucOe8H), most of them with videos at least partially done in Processing. The site also has p5.js sketches, all my sketches are free for commercial and personal use with attribution ([BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)).

I'm also a (mostly) mobile programmer at [Sniff Logic](https://www.snifflogic.com/), where we turn nasal airflow into communication and information.

I taught Computer Science at a high school for two years, and I loved teaching. I'm teaching again next year, yay!

I'm married with 3 awesome kids.

I program in Flutter, Android (Java), Swift, Drupal (HTML, JavaScript, css, PHP, yml), LabVIEW, Matlab, Arduino (C), Python, Processing (Java), Unity, C (for embedded firmware) and I probably forgot something :wink:.

In this blog I'll highlight anything that strikes me as interesting. Come join me, we'll have fun.
