This week it's been Drupal, Electron, Unity and Python. Now I honestly can't remember if I'm supposed to end the line with a semicolon or not :)

I had to remember some lost gems in Drupal, so I wrote a post about for next time: [How to Use views to query your database](https://medium.com/@dsavir-h/using-views-to-query-your-databases-in-drupal-9-51b5d88db649). This is useful for yourself but mostly for any customers who don't want or need SQL.
