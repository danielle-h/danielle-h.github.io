No space shooter game is complete without some background music and explosion sounds. Adding background music and sound effects (SFX) to the game was actually pretty easy, barring some pitfalls with pooling which I’ll detail below.

The most time-consuming part wasn’t adding the music and effects; it was choosing them. I could spend hours listening to various tracks, explosions and power up sounds. But I want to release this game sometime, y’know?
