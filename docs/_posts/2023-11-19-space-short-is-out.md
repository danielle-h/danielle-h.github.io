I created a trailer using [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/):

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iobc0-rxRZA?si=hzGJZl-VZjWjGT85" ratio="16:9" %}

Kdenlive is an awesome free and open source video editor that is capable of so much more than I asked of it.

Space short was created using Unity Personal, check out the credits [here](https://danielle-honig.com/space-short-credits/)
