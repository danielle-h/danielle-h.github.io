I created a trailer using [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iobc0-rxRZA?si=hzGJZl-VZjWjGT85" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kdenlive is an awesome free and open source video editor that is capable of so much more than I asked of it.

Space short was created using Unity Personal, check out the credits [here](https://danielle-honig.com/space-short-credits/)
