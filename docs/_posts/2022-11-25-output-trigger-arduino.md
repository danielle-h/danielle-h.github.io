A hardware trigger is a signal that is used to synchronize the operation of two or more devices. It can be used to start or stop an operation, or to indicate that a particular event has occurred. In the below step-by-step tutorial, I will show you how to use an Arduino to output a hardware trigger signal, and how to communicate to the Arduino from different programming languages. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Arduino user, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge you need to start using hardware triggers in your projects.
