description: Free screen recorder and gif maker Easiest way to upload your videos to Medium

I’ve been writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dsavir-h) for some time now, and I use gifs extensively in
my articles. Some are just cool gifs from [Giphy ](https://giphy.com/)or
[Tenor](https://tenor.com/), which Medium supports out of the box.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Writing on Medium all the time. (<a href="https://tenor.com/view/kermit-the-

However, a lot of my gifs would have actually been videos…but **Medium does
not support adding videos to your stories**. You can embed from YouTube,
Vimeo, or other site; but you can’t upload your own. Gifs are a great solution
to this: create your screen recording, convert to a gif, and upload that!
(Alternatively, create a screen recording through the Android Emulator and
save as a gif).

But… this gets tedious.

[ **ScreenToGif**](https://www.screentogif.com/) **is an awesome tool for one-
stop gifs** : It records your screen(in an area you define) and converts it to
a gif, including editing, cropping, resizing , etc. Easy Peasy.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Recorded, trimmed, lowered frame count, and resized. See?</h6>

You can:

- Record any area of your screen/ webcam/ sketchboard
- Trim or cut any area from the recording
- Crop or resize all images
- Save as video or gif

You can also use it to edit an existing gif.

**For free**.

As opposed to many free apps, it **doesn’t bombard you with ads** , or
requests to buy coffee. You have to actually search for it if you’re
interested (Extras → Options → Donate). **It. Just. Works**.

As if all this isn’t enough, it’s also [open
source](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif).

I’ve used this extensively in all my articles, whether to record a screen or
to edit the gifs saved from the Android Emulator. And it as made my life
**much** easier.

What’s your tool of choice?
